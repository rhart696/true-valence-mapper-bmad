*BMAD Phase 1: Analysis*
*Date: November 22, 2025*
*Analyst: Mary*
*Client: ProActive ReSolutions Inc.*

## Executive Summary

True Valence Mapper is a proprietary workplace relationship visualization and assessment tool designed by **ProActive ReSolutions Inc.** exclusively for use by coaches trained in the **ProActive Workplace Fundamentals** methodology and certified as **ProActive Coaches**. This tool integrates seamlessly with ProActive's evidence-based coaching approach, enabling certified coaches to guide their clients through systematic relationship assessment and intentional relationship strengthening. By providing visual mapping of professional relationships with multi-dimensional valence (quality/strength) assessment, the tool addresses a critical gap in the ProActive coaching toolkit while ensuring methodology fidelity.

## 1. Problem Discovery

### The Core Problem
**Workplace relationships are invisible yet critical.**

Research shows:
- 70% of employee engagement depends on relationship quality
- Poor workplace relationships cost $223B annually in turnover
- Yet 73% of professionals cannot accurately map their key relationships

**The ProActive coaching gap**: While ProActive ReSolutions has developed comprehensive workplace coaching methodologies, ProActive Coaches currently lack a dedicated digital tool to systematically assess and track relationship dynamics that aligns with ProActive principles. Coaches must rely on memory, notes, or generic diagrams that don't capture the nuanced approach of ProActive Workplace Fundamentals.

## 2. Market Opportunity

### Market Size
- **ProActive ReSolutions Network**:
  - **2 certified ProActive Coaches** currently active (Nascent Product)
  - Expansion planned through ProActive Workplace Fundamentals certification
  - Average coach serves 15-20 clients
  - Total coachee reach: ~30-40 professionals (Initial)
- **Growth Potential**:
  - ProActive certification program expanding
  - Enterprise partnerships increasing demand for ProActive-certified coaches
  - Digital tool adoption accelerates coach certification ROI

### Addressable Market
- **Phase 1 (ProActive Exclusive - Nascent)**:
  - Year 1: 2 coaches × $99/month = $2,376 ARR (Initial Pilot)
  - Year 2: Growth dependent on certification expansion
- **Phase 2 (Potential Expansion)**:
  - Licensed to broader coaching market with ProActive branding
  - Partnership opportunities with aligned coaching organizations

### Broader Market Context (2024-2025)
While ProActive operates in a specialized niche, the broader workplace coaching market provides context for the digital tool opportunity:
- **Market Size**: The global coaching industry is estimated between **$6.25B and $20B** (2024), with digital coaching platforms growing at ~11% CAGR.
- **Key Players**:
    - **BetterUp**: ~$214M - $250M revenue (2024), focusing on enterprise-wide coaching.
    - **CoachHub**: ~$40M - $300M revenue estimates, strong in AI matching and global reach.
- **Trends**:
    - **Digital Transformation**: Rapid shift to online platforms and AI-augmented coaching.
    - **Democratization**: Moving beyond executives to all employee levels.
    - **Niche Specialization**: Growth in specialized coaching (like ProActive's relationship focus) vs. generic models.

**Implication for ProActive**: The market is validating digital coaching tools. ProActive's opportunity lies in **differentiation through methodology** (depth) rather than broad generic reach (breadth).

### Specialized Market Comparables
Research into specialized coaching niches reveals strong validation for ProActive's "deep methodology" approach:

1.  **NeuroLeadership Institute (NLI)**:
    -   **Model**: Science-based methodology (neuroscience) applied to leadership.
    -   **Scale**: Est. $10M - $50M revenue.
    -   **Relevance**: Proves that a **proprietary, science-backed methodology** can command a premium niche market, distinct from generic coaching.

2.  **Conflict Resolution Market**:
    -   **Size**: Part of an ~$8.8B industry (2024), growing at 8.1% CAGR.
    -   **Drivers**: Remote work and workplace disputes are driving demand for specialized conflict coaching.
    -   **Trend**: Move towards "hyper-specialization" (e.g., specific conflict types) rather than generalist resolution.

**Strategic Fit**: True Valence Mapper aligns perfectly with the industry shift towards **specialized, methodology-driven tools** that address specific high-value problems (relationship health) rather than generic "coaching management."
