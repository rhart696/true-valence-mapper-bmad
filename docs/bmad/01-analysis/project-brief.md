## Executive Summary

True Valence Mapper is a proprietary workplace relationship visualization and assessment tool designed by **ProActive ReSolutions Inc.** exclusively for use by coaches trained in the **ProActive Workplace Fundamentals** methodology and certified as **ProActive Coaches**. This tool integrates seamlessly with ProActive's evidence-based coaching approach, enabling certified coaches to guide their clients through systematic relationship assessment and intentional relationship strengthening.

**The ProActive coaching gap**: While ProActive ReSolutions has developed comprehensive workplace coaching methodologies, ProActive Coaches currently lack a dedicated digital tool to systematically assess and track relationship dynamics that aligns with ProActive principles. Coaches must rely on memory, notes, or generic diagrams that don't capture the nuanced approach of ProActive Workplace Fundamentals.

  - Enterprise partnerships increasing demand for ProActive-certified coaches
  - Digital tool adoption accelerates coach certification ROI

### Addressable Market
