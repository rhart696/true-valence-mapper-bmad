If you're not sure what to do, load any AI agent and run:

```
*workflow-init
```

This will guide you through the BMAD setup process.

## Integration with True Valence Mapper

This edition explores how BMAD's requirements modeling framework can enhance relationship mapping:

1. **Requirements Capture**: Use BMAD patterns to formalize relationship mapping requirements
2. **Validation Workflows**: Apply BMAD validation to relationship data integrity
3. **AI Orchestration**: Leverage BMAD's multi-agent patterns for complex mapping scenarios
4. **Documentation**: Use BMAD's specification patterns for relationship definitions

## Usage

After installation, BMAD commands are available:

```bash
# Initialize a new BMAD project
bmad init

# Run workflows
bmad workflow <name>

# Validate project structure
bmad validate
```
